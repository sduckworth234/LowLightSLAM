# LowLightSLAM

A research platform for evaluating visual SLAM performance in low-light environments, specifically designed for search and rescue robotics applications. This work integrates state-of-the-art low-light image enhancement techniques with visual SLAM systems to improve localization and mapping capabilities in challenging lighting conditions.

## Overview

This repository contains a fully integrated ROS workspace that combines:
- **ORB-SLAM3**: Visual SLAM system with tested and verified configuration
- **Zero-DCE Enhancement**: Real-time low-light image enhancement 
- **Gazebo Simulation**: Realistic robot simulation environment with TurtleBot3
- **ROS Integration**: Custom wrapper enabling seamless integration between components

## Research Context

This work is part of ongoing thesis research focused on developing robust visual SLAM systems for search and rescue operations. The primary objective is to enhance robot navigation capabilities in low-light environments commonly encountered in disaster scenarios, such as collapsed buildings, underground spaces, or nighttime operations.

## Configuration

### Camera Calibration
Camera parameters are located in:
```
src/orb_slam3_ros_wrapper/config/
â”œâ”€â”€ EuRoC.yaml          # EuRoC dataset parameters
â”œâ”€â”€ TUM_mono.yaml       # TUM dataset parameters
â””â”€â”€ RealSense.yaml      # RealSense camera parameters
```

### Enhancement Parameters
Zero-DCE enhancement settings:
```
src/zero_dce_ros/config/zero_dce_params.yaml
```

### ORB-SLAM3 Configuration
SLAM parameters can be adjusted in:
```
src/orb_slam3_ros_wrapper/config/ORB_SLAM3/
```

## Performance Considerations

- **Real-time Performance**: Zero-DCE enhancement adds ~50-100ms latency depending on image resolution
- **Memory Usage**: Approximately 2-4GB RAM for complete pipeline
- **GPU Acceleration**: CUDA support significantly improves enhancement speed
- **Image Resolution**: 640x480 recommended for real-time operation

## Future Development

### Planned Enhancements
1. **Additional Low-Light Models**: Integration of SCI (Self-Calibrating Illumination) and other state-of-the-art LLIE methods
2. **Person Detection**: YOLO-based human detection for search and rescue applications
3. **Multi-Sensor Fusion**: Integration with LiDAR and thermal imaging
4. **Evaluation Framework**: Comprehensive performance assessment tools

### Research Applications
- Search and rescue robotics in low-light environments
- Underground exploration and mapping
- Disaster response and recovery operations
- Indoor navigation in power-limited scenarios

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**ORB-SLAM3 Build Failures:**
- Run `./verify_orbslam3_deps.sh` to check dependencies
- Ensure all Thirdparty libraries build successfully
- Check `ORB_SLAM3_WORKING_CONFIG.md` for known working versions

**ROS Integration Issues:**
- Verify ROS environment: `echo $ROS_DISTRO`
- Source workspace: `source devel/setup.bash`
- Check topic connections: `rostopic list`

**Zero-DCE Performance:**
- For slow enhancement, reduce image resolution
- Install CUDA version of PyTorch for GPU acceleration
- Monitor system resources during operation
